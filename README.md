# Linear Regression From Scratch

## Overview
Welcome! This project aims to provide a Python implementation of linear regression, a powerful statistical method used for modeling the relationship between variables. Linear regression is a fundamental technique in the fields of machine learning, statistics, and data science, and it finds applications in a wide range of domains, including finance, healthcare, economics, and engineering. 

This repository has the Jupyter Notebook that holds all of the source code as well as a sample dataset to try this code out on. 

## What is Linear Regression?
Linear regression is a statistical approach for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It assumes that this relationship can be approximated by a linear function.

The goal of linear regression is to estimate the coefficients of the linear equation that best fits the observed data. This is done by minimizing the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. Once the model is trained, it can be used to make predictions on new data or to infer relationships between variables, which can be extremely useful in many lab settings with slightly varying data to find the best fit line of a linear expression.

## Usage
To get started with the linear regression model:
* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Install the required dependencies.
* Run the provided Python script to train the model and make predictions.
* Customize the model parameters and data inputs as needed for your specific use case.
* Evaluate the results and visualize the relationships between variables using the code provided!
